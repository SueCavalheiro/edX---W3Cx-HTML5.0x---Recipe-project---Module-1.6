# edX---W3Cx-HTML5.0x---Recipe-project---Module-1.6

Recipe project - Module 1

Throughout the course, we'll be building a simple project, adding to it with what we've learned in each module. This project will be a simple Web application that will allow you to browse different recipes.

For now, we'll start off with a simple first draft using just what we've learned about HTML5 using tags we've covered.  We want to have the following components:

A large title for the app, something like "My Favorite Recipes", or whatever you'd like to call it.
A description of a recipe, just some plain text explaining what the recipe is and any other pertinent information.
A set of steps to follow, numbered in order.
